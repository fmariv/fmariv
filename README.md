My name is Fran Mart√≠n and I'm Product Manager & Data Scientist at [Earthpulse](https://earthpulse.ai/), on a mission to unlock the value of earth observation data and integrate satellite analytics with market needs.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me
I consider myself lucky to have been able to combine my two passions: the world of geospatial data and creating products that genuinely help and make a positive impact on people‚Äôs lives. I love to create value and develope solutions that make a positive impact on users, addressing real-world problems and leveraging technology to deliver innovative and effective products. 

In my free time I like to hike, read books, play videogames and be a foodie, not necessarily in that order.

## :wrench: Technologies & tools
Although I am focusing on product management, I still get my hands dirty in development when needed! I'm passionate about continuously learning in the field of Geoinformation, and I feel at home in the world of geospatial development. Whether with a GIS like QGIS or ArcGIS, databases like PostGIS, vector data or raster data, cloud technologies and S3 protocols, I love automating processes and operations with Python, building APIs with FastAPI, and creating web applications with Svelte that unlock the full potential of geospatial and satellite data.
