### Hey, I'm Fran! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I'm a environmental scientist who loves maps and typing code, and I'm lucky enough to have converted both passions into my job. Currently I'm a geospatial developer at the [Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya](https://www.icgc.cat/en/), the main cartographic and spatial data based public agency in Catalonia, Spain.

My research interests include Geographic Information Science (GIS), remote sensing, and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial big data, machine learning, and cloud computing (e.g., Google Earth Engine) to study environmental change, especially surface water and wetland inundation dynamics. I am a strong advocate of open science and reproducible research. More information about my research and teaching can be found on my personal website and research blog.
