My name is Fran Martin and I'm a geospatial developer at the [Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya](https://www.icgc.cat/en/), the main cartographic and spatial data based public agency in Catalonia, Spain.

## 🙋‍♂️ About me
I'm a environmental scientist who loves maps and typing code, and I'm lucky enough to have converted both passions into my job. In my free time I like to hike, read books, play videogames and be a foodie, not necessarily in that order.

## :wrench: Technologies & tools
I'm passionate about continuously learning in the field of Geoinformation. I am especially interested in DevOps technologies and CI/CD, although my main interest at this time is the development and implementation of vector tiles standards.

## 💻 How I code?
When I have to dive into the code, I like to follow some development practices to have my code working and validated.
* I develop my code locally in virtualized environments, using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.
* I've recently started to follow the **Test Driven Development** (TDD) philosophy, first thinking and implementing the tests.
* **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Development)**, I love to automate things.
