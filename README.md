My name is Fran Martín and I'm a Earth Observation Data Scientist at [Earthpulse](https://earthpulse.ai/), trying to unlock the value of Earth Observation data and make it easy.

## 🙋‍♂️ About me
I'm a environmental scientist who loves maps and typing code, and I'm lucky enough to have converted both passions into my job. In my free time I like to hike, read books, play videogames and be a foodie, not necessarily in that order.

## :wrench: Technologies & tools
I'm passionate about continuously learning in the field of Geoinformation. I am especially interested in Data Science, DevOps technologies and CI/CD, although my main interest at this time is implementation of AI techniques in the geospatial field.

## 💻 How I code?
When I have to dive into the code, I like to follow some development practices to have my code working and validated.
* I develop my code locally in virtualized environments, using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.
* I've recently started to follow the **Test Driven Development** (TDD) philosophy, first thinking and implementing the tests.
* **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Development)**, I love to automate things.
